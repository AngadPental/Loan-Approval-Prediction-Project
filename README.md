# Loan-Approval-Prediction-Project
This report contains the Loan Approval Prediction Project included in my data science portfolio. The project is a part of the online hackathon organized by Analytics Vidhya. Evaluation of the hackathon depends on the accuracy of the model constructed, i.e., the percentage of correctly predicted loan approvals.


# Problem Statement
Dream Housing Finance (DHF) company deals in all home loans. They have a presence across all urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. Customers first apply for a home loan, after which DHF validates the customer's eligibility for the same. DHF wishes to automate the loan eligibility process (real-time) based on customer details provided while filling the online application form. A few examples of details collected are as follows:
* Gender

* Marital Status

* Education

* Number of Dependents

* Income

* Loan Amount

* Credit History, and others.

# Why Is It Necessary?
A bank's profit or loss depends mainly on loans, i.e., whether the customers are paying back the loan or defaulting. Automating loan prediction allows a bank to reduce its non-performing assets. It also saves a lot of manpower, improves the speed of customer service, and increases savings in operational costs.

Loan Prediction represents a widespread problem faced by every retail bank while lending. Automating loan prediction saves a lot of manpower and improves the speed of customer service.
